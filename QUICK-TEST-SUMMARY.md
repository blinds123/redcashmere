## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

### Pricing Mismatch Causing Checkout Failures

**THE PROBLEM:**
```
Landing Page Shows:     SimpleSwap API Accepts:
    $19 (preorder)          ✅ $29
    $59 (ship today)        ✅ $39
                           ✅ $69
                           ✅ $79
```

**WHAT HAPPENS:**
- User clicks "Pre-order $19" → Declines bump → API call with $19 → ❌ **FAILS**
- User clicks "Ship Today $59" → Declines bump → API call with $59 → ❌ **FAILS**
- User clicks "Pre-order $19" → Accepts bump → API call with $29 → ✅ **WORKS**
- User clicks "Ship Today $59" → Accepts bump → API call with $69 → ✅ **WORKS**

**RESULT:** 50% of possible checkout paths fail!

   - Option A: Update API to accept $19 and $59
   - Option B: Update landing page to $29 and $69

2. **Error Messages**
   - Current: "Unable to create order. Please try again."
   - Needed: Specific messages explaining the actual problem

3. **Deployment Mismatch**
   - Local index.html differs from deployed version
   - Different element IDs causing test failures
   - Verify which file is actually deployed

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Fix This Week

4. Add loading spinners during API calls

## 🔧 Quick Fix Recommendation

**FASTEST FIX: Update API**

Add these amounts to the SimpleSwap API whitelist:
- $19 (for preorder without bump)
- $59 (for ship today without bump)

Keep existing:
- $29 (for preorder with bump)
- $39
- $69 (for ship today with bump)
- $79

**This requires NO landing page changes and preserves all advertised prices.**
