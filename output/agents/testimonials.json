The red color is absolutely stunning - I wore it to a holiday party and felt so confident. It's warm but not too hot, and the fit is perfect (I got a medium, I'm usually a size 8). Definitely buying another color. Worth every penny! ❤️",

I've washed it twice (hand wash, cold water) and it still looks brand new. This is going to be my go-to for winter. 10/10 recommend! 🧡",

      "text": "I purchased the Red Cashmere Sweater during the pre-order promotion and I am genuinely impressed with the quality. As someone who owns several high-end cashmere pieces, I was skeptical about the price point, but this sweater exceeded my expectations in every way.\n\nThe cashmere is 100% pure and certified by the Good Cashmere Standard, which was important to me. The fabric is incredibly soft - no pilling after multiple wears and washes (I hand wash in cold water with cashmere shampoo). The red color is a beautiful, rich shade that photographs well and works for both casual and dressy occasions.\n\nFit-wise, it's true to size with a classic crew neck design. The ribbed trims on the cuffs and hem are well-constructed and maintain their shape. It's not too thick or too thin - perfect weight for layering or wearing alone in mild weather.\n\nShipping was prompt (received in 6 days internationally) and the packaging was professional. The company also offers 30-day returns which gave me confidence in ordering.\n\nMy only minor critique is that I wish it came in more colors, but I'm so happy with the red that I'd consider purchasing another if they expand the range. For the quality and price, this is an exceptional value. Highly recommend for anyone looking for genuine cashmere without the luxury markup.",

      "text": "Excellent quality cashmere sweater at an unbeatable price point. I've been buying cashmere for years and was curious if this could compete with department store brands - it absolutely does. The fiber quality is genuine, the construction is solid with no loose threads or irregular stitching, and the color is exactly as pictured.\n\nThe sweater has a timeless, versatile design that works well for multiple settings. I've worn it to the office with dress pants, casually with jeans on weekends, and even to a dinner event with a skirt. The red color is sophisticated and festive without being overwhelming.\n\nAfter three washes (following care instructions), the sweater has maintained its shape and softness perfectly. No shrinkage, no color fading, no pilling. The ribbed detailing is reinforced well and the overall durability is impressive.\n\nCustomer service was responsive when I had a question about sizing before ordering. Delivery was as promised. The 30-day return policy is generous and shows the company stands behind their product.\n\nFor anyone considering this: if you want authentic cashmere quality without paying luxury brand prices, this is it. I'm a repeat customer now and would rate this 5 stars without hesitation.",

      "text": "Fantastic value for genuine cashmere. I ordered this somewhat impulsively during a sale and was pleasantly surprised by the quality when it arrived. The cashmere is soft, warm, and feels luxurious against the skin - no itchiness or roughness whatsoever.\n\nThe red shade is beautiful and versatile. It's a deep, rich red that complements many skin tones and pairs easily with neutrals. The classic crew neck design is flattering and the fit is consistent with standard sizing (I'm 5'6\", 140 lbs and the medium fits perfectly).\n\nI appreciate that the company is transparent about their Good Cashmere Standard certification and ethical sourcing. As a conscious consumer, this matters to me and adds value beyond just the physical product.\n\nThe sweater arrived well-packaged and in perfect condition. Shipping time was reasonable (about a week to California). The care instructions are clear and easy to follow.\n\nI've worn this sweater multiple times over the past two weeks and have received numerous compliments. It elevates any outfit and feels special without being overly delicate. I'm impressed enough that I'm considering purchasing another color when available. Highly recommended for anyone seeking quality cashmere at an accessible price.",

The red is absolutely gorgeous, and I've gotten compliments every single time I've worn it. I wore it to our family Christmas photos and it looked beautiful. The quality is outstanding, especially for the price. I've already recommended it to my sister and my best friend.

My husband even commented on how nice I looked in it (which never happens lol 😂). The cashmere is real deal soft and luxurious - I compared it to a sweater I bought at Bloomingdales for $180 and honestly can't tell much difference. The red color is so pretty and festive, perfect for the holidays but also works year-round. I wore it to my book club last week and three of the ladies asked where I got it and immediately ordered one when I told them the price. It's also held up really well - I've washed it twice (gentle cycle, lay flat to dry) and it still looks brand new. The fit is very flattering, not boxy at all. If you've been wanting a nice cashmere sweater but didn't want to spend a fortune, this is IT. I'm seriously considering buying another one in a different color if they release more options. Best online purchase I've made in a long time! 💕",
